##
*The “Cricket World Cup Match Predictor” is a Python project that 
dynamically predicts the probability of winning a World Cup cricket 
match based on historical match data using linear regression models. 
The project aims to provide insights into the potential outcomes of 
upcoming matches and assist cricket enthusiasts in making informed 
predictions.* 

## Data Collection: 
The project collects historical match data including 
team performance, player statistics, venue conditions, and match 
outcomes from reliable sources or APIs.

## Data Preprocessing: 
It preprocesses the collected data by cleaning, 
transforming, and normalizing it to make it suitable for model 
training.

## Feature Selection: 
The project selects relevant features such as team 
rankings, player performance metrics, past match results, and venue 
characteristics to train the linear regression models.
Model Training: It trains multiple linear regression models using the 
preprocessed data to predict match outcomes.

## Dynamic Prediction: 
Based on real-time inputs such as team 
compositions, player form, and match conditions, the project 
dynamically calculates the probability of winning for each 
participating team.

## Visualization: 
The project visualizes the predicted probabilities using 
graphs or charts to provide users with a clear understanding of match 
dynamics and potential outcomes.

## Evaluation: 
It evaluates the performance of the linear regression 
models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, and 
recall to assess their predictive capabilities.

### Explanation of the code:
The code defines a class CricketMatchPredictor to encapsulate the 
functionality of the Cricket World Cup Match Predictor.
It loads historical match data from a CSV file and preprocesses the 
data to handle missing values and convert categorical variables to 
numerical format.
The train_model method splits the data into training and testing sets, 
trains a linear regression model using scikit-learn’s LinearRegression 
class, and evaluates the model’s performance using mean squared 
error.
The predict_probability method predicts the probability of winning for 
each team based on input features such as team rankings, venue, and 
weather conditions.
In the main block, an instance of CricketMatchPredictor is created, 
and the model is trained and used to predict the probability of winning 
for a hypothetical match between two teams at a specific venue and 
weather condition.
This code provides a basic framework for building a Cricket World 
Cup Match Predictor using linear regression models. You can extend 
it by incorporating more features, experimenting with different 
regression algorithms, and enhancing the data preprocessing and 
model evaluation steps.
